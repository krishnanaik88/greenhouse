# 🌞 **AI-Powered Solar Energy Forecasting System**

**Project Overview:**
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts solar energy production based on historical weather data and environmental conditions. The primary objective is to forecast solar energy generation accurately using weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar irradiance.

## 🧑‍💻 **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
Before training the model, you need to preprocess your historical data:

1. Download or upload your **solar energy production data** and **weather data** into the `data/` directory.
2. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, normalization, and creating time-series sequences) using the **data_preprocessing.ipynb** notebook.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data/solar_weather_data.csv', parse_dates=['timestamp'], index_col='timestamp')

# Normalize and preprocess
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
```

### **Step 2: Model Training**

You can train the LSTM model using the `main.py` script. The script will train the model with the preprocessed data and save the trained model.

```bash
python src/main.py
```

#### Key Components of the Model:
- **LSTM Architecture**: Two LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer to output solar energy prediction.
- **Optimizer**: Adam Optimizer
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### **Step 3: Predicting and Visualizing Forecast**
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on test data:

```python
# Predict future solar output
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Visualize predictions
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(actual, label='Actual Solar Power')
plt.plot(predicted, label='Predicted Solar Power')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Solar Energy Forecasting')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Solar Power (kWh)')
plt.show()
```

## 📊 **Results and Evaluation**

The model is evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** metrics. The goal is to achieve a low RMSE, ensuring the model's predictions are close to the actual solar energy generation.

### **Example Results:**

- **RMSE**: ~0.13 (on normalized values)
- **MAE**: ~0.1

The model can forecast **solar energy generation for up to 24 hours ahead** based on weather inputs.

## 🌍 **Future Improvements and Features**

- **Real-time API Integration**: Integrate with live weather APIs (like OpenWeatherMap) to forecast solar energy dynamically.
- **Multi-site Forecasting**: Extend the system to predict solar energy output for **multiple locations** using combined regional data.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Create a dashboard using **Flask** or **Dash** to display live forecasts and visualizations.
- **Energy Storage Integration**: Predict when excess solar energy can be stored and when it should be fed into the grid.
